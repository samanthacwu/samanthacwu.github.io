								Hello! My name is Samantha Wu and I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in Astrophysics at Caltech. For my research, I work on
								theoretical stellar astrophysics, using numerical calculations to study the interiors of stars. My Ph.D. advisor is Jim Fuller.
							</p>
							<p>
								Before coming to Caltech, I earned bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Astrophysics at UC Berkeley. 
								At Berkeley, I worked on TDEs with Dr. Eric Coughlin and the numerics of GRMHD simulations with Dr. Philipp Moesta. 
								Between graduating from Berkeley and starting at Caltech, I worked with Dr. Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz at UC Santa Cruz on multi-dimensional
								hydrodynamical simulations of stellar mergers.

								<b>Research Interests:</b> My current focus lies in the realm of stellar evolution and internal stellar oscillations
								with applications to pre-supernova outbursts and tidal evolution of exoplanets. I have also worked on interacting stellar
								binaries and tidal disruption events.

								<b>Pre-Supernova Outbursts</b><br> A substantial fraction of observed core-collapse supernovae across all spectroscopic types have exhibited
								signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) produced by a pre-supernova outburst of material. In some events, luminous pre-supernova
								outbursts have also been detected.
								To address this observational puzzle, I have modeled the excitation and transmission of internal gravity waves excited in the cores
								of massive stars, which can couple with acoustic waves in the envelopes of these massive stars and deposit their energy. This energy
								deposition has the potential to unbind mass and produce luminous outbursts in the weeks to years before core-collapse. I 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906....3W/abstract"> showed</a>
								that certain progenitor mass ranges are more likely to exhibit outbursts than others, and wave energy transport can precipitate 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..119W/abstract"> expansion</a>
								of stripped helium stars. 
								Pre-supernova mass loss may also be triggered by binary mass transfer between a massive star and its companion. I 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..27W/abstract"> demonstrated </a>
								for low-mass helium star progenitors that mass loss during late-stage nuclear burning is consistent
								with inferred CSM properties of a subset of type Ibn supernovae and ultra-stripped supernovae.
