								Hello! My name is Samantha Wu and I am a Carnegie Theoretical Astrophysics Center Fellow, based at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena. 
								I completed my Ph.D. in Astrophysics at Caltech in May 2024. For my research, I work on
								theoretical stellar astrophysics, using numerical calculations to study the interiors of stars.
							</p>
							<p>
								Before coming to Caltech, I earned bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Astrophysics at UC Berkeley.
								Between graduating from Berkeley and starting at Caltech, I worked with Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz's group at UC Santa Cruz.

								I developed my passion for teaching while working at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center,
								and I continued to learn about mentoring and STEM pedagogy through the Certificate of Practice in University Teaching at Caltech. 
								I have also mentored for the <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/"> LAMAT Institute </a>, a REU at UCSC. See my mentee's 
								work <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/2021/11/02/lamat-fellow-rewa-bush-receives-presentation-award-at-the-2021-sacnas-conference/">here!</a>.
								At Caltech, I was a mentor for the 
								<a href="https://connection.caltech.edu/"> Caltech Connection Program </a>, 
								which connects students at Pasadena Community College and other 
								minority-serving institutions with Caltech graduate students and postdocs for research experiences.  <br>
								I enjoy opportunities to do outreach, such as through the
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn7wYssIHVI"> Stargazing Lectures</a> for
								<a href="https://www.astro.caltech.edu/outreach"> Caltech Astronomy Outreach </a>.
								One especially memorable event was speaking at the Sequoia National Park Dark Sky Festival in September 2022. <br>
								During graduate school, I also served on the organizing committee for Caltech's Gender Minorities and Women in PMA,
								<a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/resources-programs/women-in-pma-wipma"> GWIPMA. </a>
